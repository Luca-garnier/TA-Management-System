## Project Description
This website has the following user types: student, professor, TA administrator, teaching assistant, and system operator. Please note that a user’s account may belong to more than one user type. For example, a professor could also be a TA administrator and/or the system operator. A teaching assistant could also be an instructor (professor). A student can also be a teaching assistant.

All users can belong to more than one course (professors and students belong to more than one course). The website must ask the user to select the course they want to interact with for a given feature (eg rate a TA, or chat on a channel, etc.) or automatically determine the course (if they are already within a course). How you want to handle this is up to you.

Users can only see those dashboard options that correspond to their user account type. For example, a student who is also an instructor can only see the green and blue areas in their menu.

# GREEN AREA
This consists of the portion of the website that all users can interact with. It contains the landing page, registration and login, the dashboard, logout, and rate a TA. Notice that the dashboard is only reached after successfully logging in. To login, a database of usernames and passwords must be consulted. You must use an SQL or No-SQL database. As a minimum the database must contain these fields: first and last name, email, student ID number, username, password, and courses_registered_in (plural) and semester. The user will need to specify which courses they belong to. Registration adds the new user to the database. The user self-reports the courses they have for the semester when registering. The System Operator can edit this list later. For bonus, confirmation emails to the new user, and a notification email is sent to the system operator. The landing page must be professional looking, responsive, and informative to new users. The login is incorporated into the landing page (there is no login page). When rating at TA, the user must specify which course and term. Rating a TA gives a score from 0 to 5 (where 5 means the best). This option also provides a space to leave a short twitter- like comment.


<u>YELLOW AREA</u>
The yellow area is accessed by the system operator and consists of: the management of user accounts (edit, delete, add), quick import of profs and courses from a CSV file (normally provided by the SOCS office), and a manual way to input professors and courses (instead of using the CSV file). As a bonus feature confirmation emails are sent to the user when their account was modified, deleted, or added. The CSV file has the following format: term_year, course_num, course_name, instructor_assigned_name. For example, “Winter 2022”,”COMP307”,”Intro to Website Design”,”Joseph Vybihal”. A user account contains all the information provided during registration/login. Bonus: on following years students will need to re-register on this website to specify the new courses they belong in for rating a TA. How to do this without adding a new record?

<u>BLUE AREA</u>
The TA Management area is visited by both the professor and teaching assistant. To enter this area the user must specify which course they want to interact with. After selecting the course, all the options interact only with the selected course. To switch to another course, the user must exit to the dashboard and then return to this area (or some other method can be used). The office hours and responsibilities feature allows the professor and teaching assistant to define the office hours, office locations, and duties of each TA and Prof. Look at the information contained in our course TA coordinates spreadsheet for an example of the information that must exist in this feature. The data must be stored in the database. It has a bonus feature to export (or print) something that looks similar to the TA Coordinates spreadsheet but as a report using a table format, which would be shared with students by the professor on myCourses. The TA performance log feature can only be accessed by the professor. It stores the professor’s notes about each TA in the course. The professor selects the TA from a dropdown and then is given a twitter sized space to write a note about the TA. This is appended to the database and time stamped (date & time). The professor can append multiple performance notes per TA. This DB record must have as minimum the following fields: term _year, course_num, TA_name, comment, time_stamp. The TA wish-list feature can only be accessed by the instructor. The instructor can identify to the TA administrator which TAs they would like to have next semester. This information is appended to a DB record that has as minimum the following fields: term_year_this_is_for, course_num, prof_name, TA_name. The all TAs report
Vybihal School of Computer Science 4 of 8 McGill Project COMP 307 feature can only be viewed by the professor. Selecting this feature displays an on-screen report that collects and displays all the stored information about each TA in the course. The following information is displayed: TA_name, assigned_responsibility, student rating average, performance log comments, and student rating comments. The channel feature is used by both the professor and TA and functions like a Slack channel where the teaching team can speak together. It has only one channel per course. The bonus feature TA Evaluations/Workload is an important element of this website. If you are interested in creating this feature, please email the professor.


<u>ORANGE AREA</u>
This is the TA administrator area. The administrator decides which TA should be assigned to a course. To do this well, the administrator needs to know the TA’s performance history, which courses they have been assigned to in the past, and in which responsibilities they excelled in. The administrator also needs to be aware of the professor’s TA wish list and which courses the TA wants. The import TA cohort feature is the way the administrator receives from McGill the list of teaching assistants hired by the university for that semester. It contains the courses the TA said they are interested to TA. The import is from two CSV files called CourseQuota.csv and TACohort.csv. Course Quota has the following fields: term_year, course_num, course_type, course_name, instructor_name, course_enrollment_num, TA_quota. TA_Quota is the maximum number of TAs that can be selected for the course. Course_Type refers to Regular, Seminar, Lab, Other. The website then automatically compute enrollment_num divided by TA_Quote and flags anything where the number of students per TA is lower than 30 or higher then 45. These are problematic numbers and the Administrator will need to fix that. TA Cohort has the following fields: term_year, TA_name, student_ID, legal_name, email, grad_ugrad, supervisor_name, priority(yes/no), hours(90/180), date_applied, location, phone, degree, courses_applied_for_list, open_to_other_courses(yes/no), notes. The administrator will use this information to manually match the TA to a course. The TA info/history feature gathers all the information about the selected TA from all sources: TA Cohort, student rating average, professor performance log, student rating comments, prof wish list membership, the courses they are currently assigned to TA this term. This functions as a report. The administrator will use this feature to help determine the qualification of the TA and assign/remove them for courses. The course TA history feature displays a table of each TA with the courses they have been assigned to this term and the courses they have been assigned to in the past. Note: Course History and Info History could be combined into a single report/interactable table (a single feature). Also note: the administrator wants to be able to see: (a) select a TA to see all the courses they have been assigned to, and (b) select a course number to see all the assigned TAs. The add TA to a course feature and the remove TA from a course feature both modify the same database having the following information as minimum: term_year, course_num, TA_name, student_ID, assigned_hours. The bonus feature import old TA statistics provides additional historical information from external sources. If you are interested in implementing this bonus feature, please contact the professor for more information. IMPORTANT: The Orange Area needs a lot of creativity on making it a useful place for an administrator to inspect prospective TAs, assign/reassign them to courses, and track statistics. This Orange area is the one place that you can change the organization and look from what I have described to make it more useful. For example, the orange area could be transformed into a type of dashboard/spreadsheet that displays information with buttons to select what the administrator may want to do.
